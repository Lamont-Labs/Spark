## Problem
Wellness apps often punish users for missing a day, causing streak anxiety and dropout.

## Solution
Spark™ introduces **bend-not-break streaks**, adaptive prompts, and an offline family journaling mode that encourages reflection, not guilt.

## Why Now
Post-pandemic wellness demand is high; parents and teens need grounding digital rituals.

## Differentiators
- Family-adaptive UX (Kid/Teen/Parent modes)  
- Offline-first architecture (no data leaks)  
- Streak recovery system with grace periods  
- Privacy-safe SQLite storage  
- Provenance + SBOM for demo verification  

## Buyers / Partners
Wellness orgs, family mental-health startups, mindfulness product acquirers.

## Proof Plan
Deliver reproducible demo APK + signed provenance logs proving deterministic journaling.
